# AwesomeWMConfig
Files for rc.lua and theme.lua for awesome WM

Slight varitations on the original files. 

rc.Lua has some names for the 5 first desktops, also implements compton on startup (you could do this by configuring you .bash profile too). Also added a hotkey for changing between keyboard config, but it only works if you have an XFCE environment preinstalled (so it might not be very useful if you are using a minimal approach).

theme.lua changes colors and add gaps to windows.
